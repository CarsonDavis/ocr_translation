Crinumvirat, Thoranius had sold two young boys as twins: because they looked completely alike, although one was from France, and the other from Africa. As for this: returned by Mr. Antoine who had paid three hundred sesterces for them, amounting to three thousand seven hundred fifty écus of our currency, (for the sesterce, according to the reckoning of Budé, and other learned individuals, and adjusted to the currency of France, was worth about twenty-five écus, which multiplied three hundred times, amounts to a little more, a little less, than the said sum of 3750 écus) he was at first somewhat upset, but Thoranius pointed out to him that what he was complaining about should be considered by him the most precious part of his purchase.

Sebastian Munster, a man of great learning, in his cosmography, cites Pliny, Solinus, that after the third defeat of Valore of the Burgundians, (where their Duke Charles was killed) done at the places by the Swiss: which was around the year fourteen hundred seventy-seven, a man came to Brussels, a city in the diocese of Speyer, who resembled so naturally the late...
