But even at this age, it is sometimes observed that the generative virtue begins to move in man: \& the purification of flowers in women: \& thus, man \& woman can produce strong seed, to conceive \& engender $u$. although towards the seventeenth year, \& even better towards the eighteenth, the natural virtue is much more robust \& powerful: which is why our ancestors called the eighteenth year full \& perfect puberty $\times$, \& moreover taught that in the seventeenth year, man is still almost in his childhood $J$. This is what the ancient Romans demonstrated with the beautiful children of Senators, or from other illustrious \& honorable houses, to whom until the seventeenth year, they made wear the same style of clothing that they had worn in their early childhood, namely a long robe, down to the heels, bordered all around with purple, which they called p r a x TEXTA with a small gold ring, in the shape of a heart, hung around their neck, which they called B V E L A: so that by looking at it, they would have occasion to think that they would not be considered men, except insofar as their heart would be honest, good, \& virtuous z. And if someone is still so curious, wanting to seek \& understand the reason why women are more apt for marriage than men, I will answer with Aristotle that as females, in their motherâ€™s womb, due to their coldness \& weakness, remain longer to build \& perfect themselves, sometimes waiting until the tenth month: whereas the more virtuous \& robust males, barely exceed the ninth. Also, when women are born, for the same reason of their weakness \& debility, grow \& age faster than males a. Therefore, one must attribute this to nature which makes women more apt to engender, as being fresher, \& having grown \& aged faster b: in the example of all fruit, which the smaller \& finer it is, the more promptly it ripens, \& with greater speed.
