# DECREE OF PARLIAMENT

Arnauld du Tilh, known as Pansette, from the place of Sajas, claiming to be Martin Guerre and husband of the petitioner.

## ANNOTATION III.

Here is a new kind of deception and disguise of modesty: not so different, however, from the plot of Plautus, in his first comedy, where he introduces Jupiter, extremely in love with Alcmene, wife of Amphitryon. Having no hope of overcoming her chastity with gifts, prayers, or other enticements of love, and knowing that Amphitryon had gone to fight against the Teleboans, Jupiter takes the form of Amphitryon and, pretending one night to have returned from war, deceives Alcmene. She, already pregnant by her husband, becomes pregnant again by Jupiter, which later resulted in her giving birth to two sons at the same time, one by Amphitryon, called Iphicles, and the other by Jupiter, who was named Hercules. The most splendid part of the tale was that when Amphitryon returned and had sent Sosie, his servant, ahead to his wife to announce his arrival, Sosie finds Mercury (who had already taken the form of Sosie, also a servant of Jupiter), and they argue at length over which of the two was the real Sosie. In the end, Mercury, victorious, drives the other away. And not much less happened to Amphitryon, who was harshly received by his wife, convinced he was the impostor intending to deceive her. Finally, Blepharo is elected as the arbiter to judge which of the two is the real Amphitryon, but due to the complete similarity between them, it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. Astonished, Amphitryon wished to appeal to the gods. Seeing this, Jupiter, to show Alcmene's innocence, reveals the entire affair to Amphitryon and restores peace and friendship between him and his wife.
